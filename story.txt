Once upon a time, there was a woman who lived in a city called kaka.
She had a son and named him Pepin. Pepin eat a lot of food and became fat at age of ten.

Pepin decided later in life to go to the gym to improve his body, but he became lazy
and decided he would rather eat sweets instead. His mother, who had no name,
decided to disown him due to his inability to follow through with his goals.
