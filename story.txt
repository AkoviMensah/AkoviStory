Once upon a time, there was a woman who lived in a city called kaka.
She had a son and named him Pepin. Pepin eat a lot of food and became fat at age of ten.

Pepin decided later in life to go to the gym to improve his body, but he became lazy
and decided he would rather eat sweets instead. His mother, who had no name,
decided to disown him due to his inability to follow through with his goals.

He became really overweight and later decided that he would once again
 make his goal to hit the gym. He started by going once a day for a week.
 He later increased it to two times a day. By then he was so in shape that he
qualified for the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.
